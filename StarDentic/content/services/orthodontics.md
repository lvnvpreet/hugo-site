# Orthodontic Treatment

Orthodontic treatment is designed to correct misaligned teeth and improve your bite. Whether you choose traditional braces or clear aligners, we'll help you achieve a straighter, healthier smile.

## Treatment Options

### Traditional Braces
Metal braces are the most common type of orthodontic treatment, offering reliable results for complex cases.

### Clear Aligners
Invisalign clear aligners are virtually invisible and removable, making them popular with adults and teens.

### Ceramic Braces
Tooth-colored ceramic braces offer a more aesthetic option than traditional metal braces.
