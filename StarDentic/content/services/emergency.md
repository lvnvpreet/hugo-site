# Emergency Dental Care

Dental emergencies can happen at any time. Whether you're experiencing severe tooth pain, have a knocked-out tooth, or have suffered dental trauma, we're here to help.

## Common Dental Emergencies

- Severe toothache
- Knocked-out teeth
- Cracked or broken teeth
- Lost fillings or crowns
- Abscessed teeth
- Soft tissue injuries

## What to Do in a Dental Emergency

**For knocked-out teeth**: Handle the tooth by the crown, rinse gently, and try to reinsert it. If that's not possible, keep it moist in milk or saliva.

**For severe pain**: Rinse with warm water and take over-the-counter pain medication as directed.

**For broken teeth**: Save any pieces and rinse your mouth with warm water.
